I used to live that scared. Lived like that for years. Most of my childhood. Then, when I was 15, I killed Fear. After that, I just decided I was not going to be afraid. And I’m not. But sometimes I have dreams about myself when I still was. It’s the one thing about my life I haven’t been able to change. Ive been to therapists, read books,  meditated, prayed. I even saw a hypnotist. All those things helped me become what I am today, but I guess nothing can erase my past completely. Fear will always own a piece of me. It’s revenge for the murder I committed. \\n\\nLayna, they’re all seated, my assistant prompts on her way to the door, like she wants me to be. It’s amusing how nervous she gets when i keep the board waiting. After six years of doing it at least once a quarter, you’d think she’d realize it will be fine, but quarterly board meeting make her as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. \\n\\nI turn from the several millions of dollars view and stand. I take my time smoothing my skirt and slipping the navy suit jacket over the slinky tomato red shell. This top is my favorite piece of clothing, and it’s always mostly covered, but it makes me feel powerful. I love the sensuous silky feeling against my skin, and the overwhelming red color that barely shows under the traditional tailored suit without which —despite all the claims of feminist advancement—i could not achieve the respect i require. I have to embody the image they have of someone capable of keeping this behemoth profitable, hence the suit; but i also have to keep them slightly off balance, hence the red top, and the tailoring that doesn’t completely hide my feminine curves. \\n\\nI barely nod to my cfo, Mac, as i take my seat at the head of the conference table, and he starts the meeting. He will run it, and i will speak very little, but ill be considering every smile, frown, sip of water and word when i do speak. I am not a natural powerhouse, captain of industry, leader of men. This is a performance executed amidst political and financial warfare. I saw a movie once where an underrated Asian warrior princess, trapped in an alley, sprang like a ballet dancer through the throng of her enemies, plucking pins from her hair and shoving them into jugulars as she leapt, not only escaping, but demolishing her enemy.  It plays in my head like background music diring these meetings. \\n\\nToday, though, Im not on the defensive. Im not trapped in an alley. Today, ever so slightly, i begin tipping the hand Ive been assembling for a decade. The cards are stacked in my favor, and it’s time to show them. My goal is simple: to win.

Ax is over 2000 yrs old. From the 12th to the 18th centuries Ax was head wizard at  Rivenna, a school for wizards. The students endured serious abuse in the name of education, and many died or went crazy. Ax justified it all as necessary to produce wizards able to handle magic. \\n\\nMagic is not a gift of birth. Anyone could wield it if they had the right knowledge, tools, and most of all relationships with the sources of magic. \\n\\nIn the 15th century, twin boys Twin1 and Twin2 were students at Rivenna. They became two of the most powerful wizards. Twin1 excelled at everything. He was a rule keeper. Twin2 was a free spirit and always got into trouble because he was naive and trusting. He often broke the rules in the name of mercy and fun. He learned to use magic in ways not sanctioned by Ax.\\n\\nTwin1 grows up to be a brutal villain in the name of keeping the rules and exacting justice. Twin2 becomes a screw up always on the edge of self destruction thanks to his dabbling in prohibited magic. \\n\\nTurns out the prohibited magic is the source of Ax’s hold on power, and that’s why he doesn’t want anyone learning about it. \\n\\nTwin 1 and 2 are Ax’s unacknowledged sons which is why he was so hard on them but also protected them including twin2. The twins also have the ability to use some powerful artifacts keyed to Ax’s bloodline. \\n\\nWho is their mother? Why are they not acknowledged ?

He knows and understands these changes at the micro and macro levels.\\u202f \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nPredestination means God decided the outcome ahead of time. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nBefore God created the world, he considered what He would do. The choices were infinite. He could have populated the Earth with many people from the beginning. He could have populated Jupiter with beings perfectly suited to the nature of that planet. He could have done so many more things than we can imagine. He foresaw every possible outcome. He understood all the variables and the micro and macro effect of every possible combination of every imaginable (and for us many unimaginable) variables. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nOf all the options, one resulted in beings\\u202fwho would ruin their relationship with Him. Any being must be holy and blameless (Eph 4:5) if it is to have a relationship with God, but the beings in this particular scenario would do unholy things. He could restore them back to a state of holiness and blamelessness, but that would require a great sacrifice on God\\\'s part. That sacrifice would make it possible for the beings to be conformed to the image of Jesus (Rom 1:28-30) His precious Son, and they could be adopted as sons through Jesus (Eph 1:5). But not all would be conformed. God knew who would and who would not be conformed and adopted and holy and blameless. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nGod could see the inmost parts of all the beings of this scenario. Even though they were not formed, he knew them. He loved them. But oh, the sacrifice! But more sons and daughters! What a bittersweet option this scenario is. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nHe chose them. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(So what about John 15:19? It says he chose us out of the world, not as opposed to the sacrifice of Jesus. What is the nature of "chose" in that verse?) \\n\\nApril 6, 2015\\n\\nThis is Bible-based conjecture. It is not found directly in the Bible, although there is Scriptural support for the ideas. As far as I know, it is original to me. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nCosmic Election is what I\\\'m labeling a theory that\\\'s been growing in my mind since listening to Why Suffering by Ravi Zacharias and Vince Vitale. Specifically chapter three is what launched this. Besides that book, two other factors were catalysts in this line of thinking. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nFirst, the presence of the concept of election in the Bible has bothered me since youth. No explanation outside Calvinism satisfactorily explains all its appearances in the Bible. I have tried sincerely but cannot accept Calvinism. Specifically the notion of limited atonement seems absolutely heretical. That is another topic, though. My rejection of Calvinism not withstanding, non-Calvinistic explanations of the concept of Biblical election are weak and incomplete. I have just lived with it. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nFinally, a small tidbit in William Dumbrell\\\'s book The Faith of Israel resonated with the thoughts I was already having following the Suffering book. I\\\'m jumping ahead, though. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n[Brief explanation of Suffering chap 3] \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThis prompted my consideration of God\\\'s choosing to create the world we know out of many options. Vitale is right. Differences in small variables have lasting effects. Compound that with the fact that God has certainly intervened directly many times to bring about His will on earth. The Bible tells us that before He created the world, He knew us and He knew Jesus would die[1]. He must have considered many possibilities, different interventions, different first people, different responses to our choices. He was able to look across time and see the ramifications of each choice. In some scenarios, specific people would never exist. Others who in this world came to know Jesus may have lived\\u202f lives so different they would not have believed on Jesus. God looked at all these possibilities and chose this one, the one in which I exist and came to a saving knowledge of Jesus as a child. He knew me before creation, before making His final choice of what world to create and wanted me in His eternal Heaven. I, in part, am why he chose all the details of this particular world--so He could have a relationship with me. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nDumbrell\\\'s book includes a little tidbit about Genesis 1:26, "And God said, let us make man in our own image." Almost as an aside, he mentions that the Hebrew that\\\'s translated "let us" indicates the outcome of a deliberation. I was very excited to read this as it seems like evidence for the notion that God indeed considered different possibilities. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nWhat does all this have to do with election? Well, it has always bothered me that the concept is even in the Bible if all it means is either Israel sometimes, or all saved people other times. Why introduce an equivalent concept that has nothing unique to teach us about salvation? It has always been a quandary for me. I\\\'ve put it in the "His ways are not our ways..." category. But now, it seems there is a point. Rather than choosing certain people to be saved and logically then choosing others not to be saved, what if election means he chose this scenario and those He foresaw would be saved in this scenario as opposed to those who would\\\'ve been saved in another scenario. He chose our version. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nwho saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, \\n\\n2 Timothy 1:9 ESV \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nO Lord , you are my God; I will exalt you; I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans formed of old, faithful and sure. \\n\\nISA 25:1 ESV \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n[1] even the night of His betrayal in the Garden, Jesus was asking "let this cup pass from me."

So where did sin come from if, as John Piper succinctly puts it, sinless God is the only ultimate eternal reality.\\n\\nI believe the Bible teaches the answer to this question plainly: free will chose to rebel. Sin is often defined as rebellion against God, but that definition is circular. Sin is that which is mutually exclusive to God. That the wages of sin is death is not God\\\'s proclamation of the punishment for sin but rather a description of what sin is. Sin is that which leads to death. God is life, the author of life, the giver of life and by His nature cannot be in the presence of death as it is mutually exclusive to His existence the way dryness is mutually exclusive to wetness.\\n\\nStill, where did this death come from? Did God create it? No. It existed because God existed. There is and always was God, and there is and always was that which is not God. God is the ultimate eternal reality, and there is that which is not reality. That which is not God is not an alternate power or a counter balance. It has no power. It has no will. It has no agenda. It is void. All that can be said of it is that it is not God. It is not I AM. It is not. It is death. That which leads away from the ultimate eternal reality leads to non-reality. Leads to death. That which leads to death is sin.\\n\\nSo God did not create sin, and sin itself has no power or agenda. Then why did the perfect beings in the perfect environment treated perfectly rebel and sin if sin did not entice them? There can be no answer to this question if one does not acknowledge the free will God bestowed upon man and at a minimum upon Lucifer and all who fell (likely all the angels). \\n\\nWhy would an almighty God willingly limit Himself to the whims of His inferior creatures? Worship given without the option not to give worship is worthless to the Creator. Men readily recognize and differently value that which is given willingly versus that which is coerced. Is God more naive than we, that He can trick Himself into being jealous for the worship of creatures who had no option except to give Him that worship? The idea is preposterous. If the ultimate purpose of man is to worship God, the free will of man is imperative to the nature of God Himself and no petty argument.\\n\\nAgain, though, where did the idea to choose anything other than God originate? Imagine omnipotent, matchless God, infinite, enjoying the worship of his creations, all of which are perfect, existing in perfection, treated with perfection. That their worship would be even more meaningful to Him if they had an alternative must have been self evident. It is logical, then, that He himself may have pointed out and even provided opportunity for his creatures to choose not to worship. Risk and reward, like all patterns, originate with God.\\n\\nSo God did not create sin, and He did not give his creatures the desire to sin, and he did not tempt them to sin. He created His creatures in His presence, invited to relationship, engaged in His service, but not imprisoned to His will. The form of Lucifer\\\'s sin--to be equal with God--was the appropriation of ambition to excel in service to God for the purpose of opposing God. The sin was not the ambition, but the object--self instead of God--anything instead of God--leads to death--is sin.\\n\\nIn the beginning, God never created darkness. Darkness is the absence of light. Light can be defined. Light can be measured. Light can be perceived. Light does not create darkness. It dispels darkness. \\n\\nGod did not create death or that which leads to it, sin. Sin is not a discrete entity. Even death is not a discrete entity. God can be defined and perceived entirely by His own attributes, but sin and death can only be defined and perceived in relationship to God or as the absence of God.\\n\\nBy rebelling, Satan did not raise himself to the evil equal of God. Satan remains merely a servant. Only now he serves death by enticing all he can to walk away from God and toward sin and death. God is life, but Satan is not death. God is righteousness but Satan is not sin. God is light but Satan is not darkness. \\n\\nThis way of defining sin might being to sound like nihilism, and on some abstract plane, perhaps it is, but nothing so comforting as nothingness awaits the creations of God who opt to reap the wages of sin. \\n\\nGod created man in His image for the purpose of worshiping God.Our souls are eternal. They cannot cease to exist. They can only be satisfied by fulfilling our purpose. Satan crafts experiences that offer counterfeit satisfaction for the purpose of distracting us from real satisfaction which is only had by worshiping God. This only seems to work because even while rejecting God, those alive on this earth exist in an environment infused with His life. Every good gift and every perfect gift comes from God, and even those in the process of rejecting him unknowingly enjoy the tangential benefits of the omnipresence of God.\\n\\nBut in what comes after this life, those who do not choose God will exist for eternity apart from God. They will exist in the not God, cut off from the Source of all that is good, all that is pleasant, all that is comforting, all that is satisfying, all that is restful, all that is ordered. Imagine not being able to breathe but continuing to exist. Jesus pictured this by His crucifixion--an execution that kills by slowly suffocating the agonized victim. Imagine existing for eternity in death--never getting through with death--always dying, never not dying, always existing. That is hell. Fire and gnashing of teeth and eternal falling and being eaten by worms are pale metaphors for such an eternal existence. \\n\\nWhat I believe the Bible teaches about sin is one of the primary reasons I cannot be a Calvinist. One of the reasons I like Piper is because even though he is a Calvinist, he does not make up answers to hard questions just to have a "Calvinist" answer. He acknowledges this as a long-time mystery for himself. I think it will always be because sin cannot be understood apart from free will.\\n\\nAccording to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo sin is "a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God."\\nWhat if the eternal law of God was given to keep us on the path of life and off the path of death. Violation of the law is sin but is not the primary definition of sin. The law is life, therefore violating the law is death, therefore violating the law is sin.\', \'title\': \'Explorative Thinking: Where did Sin Come From\', \'userEditedTimestampUsec\': 1553747121473000, \'createdTimestampUsec\': 1553738540866000, \'labels\': [{\'name\': \'Calvinism\'}, {\'name\': \'Bible\'}, {\'name\': \'Free will\'}, {\'name\': \'Sin\'}], \'keep_export_file\': \'Explorative Thinking_ Where did Sin Come From.json\', \'created_at\': \'2019-03-27_210220\', \'edited_at\': \'2019-03-27_232521\', \'tags\': [\'calvinism\', \'bible\', \'free-will\', \'sin\', \'color-blue\', \'created-2019\']}', "{'color': 'CERULEAN', 'isTrashed': False, 'isPinned': False, 'isArchived': False, 'textContent': 'Staying near Victoria Station is my favorite home base.

Take the latest train you can and still get to your hotel in time to go to bed reasonably. Read a book about Mary Queen of Scots before you go. She lived in Edinburgh Castle, and it’s largely as it was when she lived there.\\n\\nOne day\\nStay near the Holyrood House end of The Royal Mile. Tour Holyrood in the morning. Meander up the mile, shopping and nibbling all the way. Tour Edinborough castle at the end. \\n\\nAnother day\\nTake a bus tour to Loch Lomond and Stirling Castle. Be prepared to not understand a word the Scots say. Ideally, you could make these your last two days and fly out of Edinburgh. \\n\\nYou can get to Paris by mid-morning through the Chunnel. It’s actually quicker than Edinburgh. I cannot get excited enough about Paris to say much about it except that I did love the Louvre and could’ve spent a month there. Versailles is also worth the trouble. Obviously, the food will be much better than in London.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Favorite Things in London', 'userEditedTimestampUsec': 1587353401168000, 'createdTimestampUsec': 1583537707315000, 'labels': [{'name': 'journal'}, {'name': 'travel'}], 'keep_export_file': 'Favorite Things in London.json', 'created_at': '2020-03-06_173507', 'edited_at': '2020-04-19_223001', 'tags': ['journal', 'travel', 'color-cerulean', 'created-2020']}", '{\'color\': \'BLUE\', \'isTrashed\': False, \'isPinned\': False, \'isArchived\': False, \'textContent\': "It\'s not necessarily that the thing we fear will not come to pass, but that we need not fear it because God is in control of even the feared thing.

While we were sitting at the wrong spot, Johnathan and I were talking and at some point, we realized Jack had rolled down his window and was displaying a salt-dough turkey he had painted at school while calling out loudly and repeatedly, "Get your beautiful turkey! Only five dollars and ten cents plus a dime!" I laughed, and Johnathan tried to get him to hush, but he was so determined. We were focused on finding the right place to pick up our groceries and began driving through the parking lot. Jack continued hocking his warez to every passerby. At one point, he told us if he could just have permission to get out of his buckles and take his turkey to the people, he would certainly sell it. Finally, we found the right pickup place in the side parking lot where few people wandered. Everyone who did, though, was offered a beautiful painted salt-dough turkey plus one dime (the dime was part of the package) for only $5.10.\\u202f \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAs you might imagine, Jack could not sell his piece, and on the way home, I told him I wanted to buy it to display in my office.

I questioned this with due incredulity, and he quickly pointed out to me that this was the ONLY turkey, and unless Mrs. Marite at school helped him make another one, there would be no more turkeys, and I was very fortunate to get this one-and-only turkey for $10.10.

For example, sweater yokes require increasing or decreasing every other or every third row. Lace in the round often alternates one pattern row and one plain row. Sleeve shaping is usually done every 4th or 5th row. It\'s simple enough. The problem comes in when we set our knitting aside for awhile and come back to it. It\'s almost impossible to remember, and sometimes it can be hard to read your knitting to tell where you are in the repetition of rows. Of course, there are those knitters who studiously note their patterns or some notes every time they look away from their knitting. I do that with very complicated ones. But I really love knitting that I don\'t have to keep track of like that, and it just seems after knitting quite a few sweaters, I should be able to manage the yoke and sleeves without making a note every time I have to walk away. So I came up with this little trick that works great for me for these specific situations where you\'re doing something unique every X number of rows several times. All I do is clip an extra stitch marker somewhere in the completed knitting near the beginning of the row. If this is an increase row, I move the marker to hang off the first pattern marker. Otherwise I slip the marker through the number of strands that represents the current row in the repetition. So if this is row 3, I slip it around 3 strands. I like using the big giant Clover markers for this. Obviously, this is only useful to track the simplest of row repeats, but aren\'t those the ones you want to take along? By using just an extra marker like this, I can keep up with which row I\'m on without making and taking notes everywhere I take my knitting. Very handy for playgrounds and knit nights.

Assembly lines provide a powerful metaphor for managing consistency, efficiency and quality. Assembly lines are very mature and have a significant body of business practice and academic literature. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe mortgage industry is a volume business that should be run like an assembly line from start to finish. Managing the business is managing the assembly line. Regulations dictate how the assembly line looks, in part, and they dictate how long a unit may be or must be in certain segments of the assembly line. Both operational and regulatory changes are effected in the assembly line. Management and regulatory oversight are accomplished by monitoring the current state of the assembly line and looking at past performance on the assembly line. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nIn the mortgage business, where a unit is on the assembly line cannot be ascertained by its physical presence. Rather, its place in the assembly line is indicated by its features, and more exactly, by the data that indicates its features. For example, are the key six pieces of information in place? Has the application been moved to the Submitted milestone in Encompass? Has the closing disclosure sent date been populated? All these pieces of data indicate a different place on the assembly line. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nUnlike a physical factory assembly line, a unit in the mortgage business can be running through more than one assembly line at a time. Before the LE is disclosed, the rate must be locked, and from that point, the rate lock has its own assembly line that must run in tandem with the loan itself. Once the loan enters the Underwriting segment of the assembly line, the closing segment of the assembly line may also begin working on the loan before Underwriting is complete. This enables a faster closing. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nWould it be useful to think of these as parts that will be brought together to create the finished product instead of parallel assembly lines? How do parts come together into a whole? They have fittings and interfaces that meet prescribed standards which ensure the parts all fit together in the end to create one unit. Research the pros and cons of modular design. My impression is it is almost universally considered superior, but are there exceptions, and is a component architecture the best metaphor for a mortgage loan? \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAnother caveat of the mortgage industry that must be accommodated is the potential for a unit to change what it is. If Underwriting determines the requirements of the specific type of mortgage underway cannot be satisfied by the borrower\'s situation, it may be that another type of mortgage would be meet the borrowers needs and situation. The unit will be sent back in the assembly line, but probably not back to the beginning, and have its features changed.

There\\\'s a lot here to aid in getting an uncontrolled stash in order. Just skip those parts. You\\\'ll find plenty of great tips for improving and scaling your stash organization. \\n\\n \\nExtreme stashers be warned: this process will probably take longer and require more space than you anticipate. Plan accordingly. \\n\\n \\n\\nGather all things knitting: yarn, WIPs, undistributed and unused FOs, notions, needles, bags and containers that have knitting stuff in them. Be thorough and be honest. If you know an ancient WIP is tucked far back in your closet, dig it out. Be ruthlessly honest with yourself and get it all out in the open. Hopefully in a room with a door to hide the mayhem from full view of the family. (I know you.)  \\n\\n \\nGet containers to organize into. I recommend scrounging around for anything large you already have that will hold yarn. Wait until you have it somewhat organized before spending a lot of money on new containers. Cardboard boxes, laundry bins, anything with sides that stand up (so you can toss yarn into them) work great. If you have bins made of something that could snag the yarn, line them with garbage bags. This is temporary. \\n\\n \\nGet several sizes of ziploc bags. I like snack sizes with the closure on the short size for small notions and buttons. Sandwich and gallon sizes are good for corralling remnants, balls that are prone to tangling and small projects. \\n\\nGet a stack of sheet paper and thick tip marker and something to secure the paper to the containers. Scotch tape, paper clips, binder clips, bobby pins, whatever works. Again, this is all temporary. Don\\\'t go buy a bunch of stuff. Scrounge. \\n\\n \\nNow sit and contemplate your stash. You probably ran across yarn you forgot about, and maybe you realized you have a lot more of a certain type of yarn than you thought you did. You need to separate your stash into categories that will facilitate your getting maximum use out of it. For most people, that means knitting it. You may do a lot of trading, and that could affect how you organize. There is no definitive list of all the categories you should have. You could divide it by fiber and weight. No need for me to list all that out for you, but if you have almost all cold weather fiber like wool and alpaca and hardly any warm weather fiber like bamboo and cotton, you may want to just have one warm-weather bin instead of separating those out. You might consider further dividing it up by value and premium. For example, value acrylic from a big box store vs premium acrylic from a local yarn shop. A novelty category is almost always useful. If you have a lot of a particular fiber, you may segment out your favorites and have a "Preferred Wool" category. Instead of dividing for every weight, you might want to have small, medium and large classes. Small for lace and fingering. Medium for sport, DK, worsted and aran. Large for bulky, super bulky and plum ridiculous. If you tend to do a lot of a particular type of knitting like sweaters, socks, baby clothes, chemo hats, etc, and you have certain yarn that is designated for those purposes, think of these as special collections that defy the others. Create a category for these and put yarn you want to designate for those purposes into those categories, regardless of the fiber or weight. You can do this for specific projects as well. That\\\'s especially useful if you have a project that will include yarn that doesn\\\'t obviously go together. For example, maybe you have sock yarn in black and orange you intend to use for a flame hat for your son. Feel free to package those up in a zipper bag, label it and place it in a future projects category. \\n\\nPossible Stash Categories\\nRemnants \\n\\nNovelty \\n\\nDesignated project - this is yarn designated for a specific project. Keep each project in its own clear bag, and keep them all together in a "Future Projects" bin. \\n\\n \\nDesignated purpose - these are collections of yarn you want to set aside for a general purpose like socks, hats, sweaters, etc. If you do a lot of a particular type of knitting, you may want to keep that yarn separate even though you don\\\'t have it all assigned to specific projects yet. Give each purpose it\\\'s own bin. \\n\\n \\nI like to organize everything else on three axes: fiber, weight and value. \\n\\n \\nFiber categories are pretty straightforward. Don\\\'t feel like you must separate every fiber. You can group cold weather fibers like wool and alpaca or warm weather fibers like cotton and bamboo. If you like to keep the pure stuff separate, have a category for Wool Blends or Cold Weather Blends. Same for washables, if that\\\'s a big part of your stash. \\n\\n \\nSimilarly, weight categories are straightforward, but most can get by with small (lace, fingering); medium (sport, dk, worsted, aran); and heavy (bulky, super bulky). \\n\\n \\nValue is a little more opaque. You could separate big box and yarn shop yarns. A "preferred" category is handy if you find your favorites include all types and you want to keep those handy. \\n\\n \\nHere\\\'s how I end up organizing my stash. This won\\\'t work for everyone, but it might be handy for everyone to see how I tailor all the possibilities to my needs. \\n\\n \\nPremium yarn of every category is on display by color in one glass-front cabinet. \\n\\n \\nEverything else is in the following bins: \\n\\nRemnants - further subdivided into ziploc bags. \\n\\nDishrag cotton \\n\\nCotton blends \\n\\nWarm weather blends\\u202f \\n\\n100% cotton \\n\\nSpool cotton \\n\\nNovelty \\n\\nValue acrylic, med weight \\n\\nValue acrylic, heavy weight \\n\\nCold weather blends \\n\\nCold weather, med weight (labeled "Wool") \\n\\n \\nWIPs are divided like: \\n\\nWIPs (current/recent) \\n\\nHibernating (old) \\n\\nTo be frogged \\n\\n \\nFuture expansion: organizing notions, needles \', \'title\': \'Organizing Your Yarn Stash\', \'userEditedTimestampUsec\': 1577846394073000, \'createdTimestampUsec\': 1577846302783000, \'labels\': [{\'name\': \'Yarn\'}], \'keep_export_file\': \'Organizing Your Yarn Stash.json\', \'created_at\': \'2019-12-31_203822\', \'edited_at\': \'2019-12-31_203954\', \'tags\': [\'yarn\', \'created-2019\']}', "{'color': 'DEFAULT', 'isTrashed': False, 'isPinned': False, 'isArchived': False, 'textContent': 'du_learns@outlook.com\\nroot', 'title': 'Outlook acct for class', 'userEditedTimestampUsec': 1567016552547000, 'createdTimestampUsec': 1566922755143000, 'labels': [{'name': 'Credentials'}], 'keep_export_file': 'Outlook acct for class.json', 'created_at': '2019-08-27_111915', 'edited_at': '2019-08-28_132232', 'tags': ['credentials', 'created-2019']}", "{'color': 'DEFAULT', 'isTrashed': False, 'isPinned': False, 'isArchived': False, 'textContent': 'When faced with an overwhelming power, the only options are to serve it or destroy it', 'title': 'Overwhelming Power', 'userEditedTimestampUsec': 1673566466155000, 'createdTimestampUsec': 1673566450333000, 'labels': [{'name': 'Novel'}, {'name': 'Original'}], 'keep_export_file': 'Overwhelming Power.json', 'created_at': '2023-01-12_173410', 'edited_at': '2023-01-12_173426', 'tags': ['novel', 'original', 'created-2023']}", "{'color': 'PURPLE', 'isTrashed': False, 'isPinned': False, 'isArchived': False, 'textContent': 'Pain is knowledge rushing in to fill a gap.\\n\\nJerry Seinfeld\\nCommedians in cars getting coffee', 'title': 'Pain is knowledge', 'userEditedTimestampUsec': 1522458747810000, 'createdTimestampUsec': 1522458709598000, 'labels': [{'name': 'Quotes'}], 'keep_export_file': 'Pain is knowledge.json', 'created_at': '2018-03-30_201149', 'edited_at': '2018-03-30_201227', 'tags': ['quotes', 'color-purple', 'created-2018']}", "{'color': 'DEFAULT', 'isTrashed': False, 'isPinned': False, 'isArchived': False, 'textContent': 'large sql statements seem to be slowing down with parameter injection.

We often get stuck on one and become blind to the others.\\n\\nThe more complex the result, the higher the likelihood that there is more than one reason for a competing result.\\n\\nData are often ambiguous and business leaders often prevaricate on setting forth hard and fast business rules to clarify each situation. Nevertheless, results cannot be had without such clarity, and developers often find themselves forced to decide how ambiguous data will be handled. In these situations, communication and documentation are key. Be repetitive to the point of annoying in requesting clarification. Provide real world examples. When the point comes that the project cannot progress without a decision, make the decision yourself and over-communicate. Note the unofficial business decision in your code. These are very often the source of a calculation, population or timing difference between your results and challenge results.", \'title\': \'Proving Data\', \'userEditedTimestampUsec\': 1577989897020000, \'createdTimestampUsec\': 1577989050175000, \'labels\': [{\'name\': \'Business Intelligence\'}], \'keep_export_file\': \'Proving Data.json\', \'created_at\': \'2020-01-02_121730\', \'edited_at\': \'2020-01-02_123137\', \'tags\': [\'business-intelligence\', \'color-brown\', \'created-2020\']}', '{\'color\': \'BLUE\', \'isTrashed\': False, \'isPinned\': False, \'isArchived\': False, \'textContent\': \'\\nfrom April 28, 2015\\n\\nTo the choirmaster.

Neither the host of heaven, nor Satan and the rebel angels knew God\'s plan. Jesus\' death was Satan\'s greatest miscalculation. By taking the life that was not owed, the life not under the curse of sin, the life of the Perfect Man, the life of the King of Glory--Satan\'s position was fatally downgraded from lien-holder to hopelessly indebted. \\n\\nSee, before Before Jesus\' death, Satan held the rights to every human life because of Man\'s sin. With the one sin in the Garden of Eden, Adam made debtors of all of humanity. That sin was a transaction in which man sold himself and all his posterity to Satan.\\n\\nBut Jesus was not a mere man. Jesus\' death was different. Satan had no right to that life. Death had no claim on Him. Three days after His Death, the twist was revealed. Jesus entered into Death, but Death could not hold him! Instead of succumbing to the power of Death, weilded by Satan for millenia over man, this Man--the God Man--defeated Death and returned to Life. \\n\\nSatan\'s lien was paid in full, and no one was more shocked than Satan. Jesus\' resurrection was seismic event in the supernatural economy. The bondage of humanity was broken, and those who walked in darkness could now see a great light!\\n\\n\\nNo one but God had understood the details of his plan. The prophets had been sufficiently opaque to hide the details yet sufficiently concrete to confirm the Truth of everything.\\n\\nWhere before he was the lien-holder to the lives of all of humanity--lives which he uses for the sole purpose of inflicting maximum pain on the Creator of those lives to himself being indebted to the Righteous God for a debt that triggered the transfer of rights over the souls of men from Satan\'s balance sheet to God\'s balance sheet. And more than this, during his three days in death, Jesus wrested the keys of death--the source of Satan\'s power--from Satan.\\n\\nAnd so with the resurrection, the great Cosmic war was won. It was finished. Now, God resumes the same offer to men that he made to Adam and Eve in the Garden : Choose life or death. It is the choice of every man. God\'s integrity is too great to desire worship that is not freely given. But He will not always strive with man. The day is coming when Satan and all those who have not accepted the ransom from sin\'s curse provided by Jesus\' death will be thrown into the lake of fire--a place where eternal souls who cannot cease to exist live forever in the process of dying a death that will never be complete.

But review that becomes second guessing and planning that becomes worrying are not merely unproductive; they are counterproductive. \\n\\nThe purpose of review is not to analyze your own or others behavior. Review is about making sure nothing slipped through the cracks through forgetfulness or misinterpretation. \\n\\nSimilarly, planning is an exercise in identifying next actions, not crafting a forecast of all that could happen much less worrying about it. \\n\\nIt is certainly true that reflecting on ones own behavior and trying to identify future risks of various courses of action are worthwhile endeavors. But these should be done far less frequently than daily. This kind of analysis is taxing and harmful if done incorrectly. \\n\\nIf your daily review and planning time frequently devolves into a stress-inducing exercise in self doubt and worry, you’re doing it wrong!\\n\\nThat’s easy to say, but when you’re actually thinking through your day and planning the next day, it can seem almost impossible not to fall prey to self doubt and worry. Maybe you really did behave badly in a meeting. Maybe there are real risks involved in your current project that should concern you. What are you supposed to do with those things?\\n\\nFor the Christian, the answer is very different than it would be for a non-Christian. When Jesus was on the earth, He invited us to handle our stress in a remarkable way in Matthew 11:38-31\\n\\nMatthew 11:28–30 (ESV): Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. \\r\\n 29  Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. \\r\\n 30  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” \\n\\nJesus alludes to a practice familiar to His audience in this agrarian society. Weak and young oxen are teamed with strong mature oxen so that the weaker can learn the way of pulling as a team while paired with one who can shoulder most of the load for both. Listeners would have immediately understood the point. Jesus is the strong mature one. If we team up with him, he will shoulder the heavy load. He knows what to do. Our burden will be easy and light. \\n\\nIn the midst of self doubt and worry, how do we actually do this? After all , it’s not as if there’s a physical yoke we need to put on. How do we take our very real work that must get done and allow Jesus to shoulder the load?\\n\\nThe answer is nothing new: trust God? But how?! \\n\\nWhen stress-inducing thoughts come out of turn—that is, work stress when you’re with family, or any stress when you’re trying to sleep, say a quick prayer and tell the Lord what you’re worried about and that you’re leaving it with Him. Refusing to think about them is an act of trust in God. Especially when you have no power over the source of stress, racking your brain for a solution to something you can’t change is to actively choose your own strength over God’s. The thoughts that come will slow when you make a habit of giving them to God and refusing to let them rob the other areas of your life of peace. Filling your conversation with friends incessantly about all the troubles you’re trusting Gods with and all the details he’s going to have to work out is not trusting God. Turning your mind away from those worries is trusting that whatever happens is Gods plan. \\n\\nThe practice of regurgitating a particularly difficult situation quickly becomes a habit, and we are deceived when we think we can’t help it. We think the bad habit of not trusting God and feeling in these thoughts is evidence of just how bad this particular situation is. We just can’t stop obsessing. \\n\\nThe Bible has a remedy for this as well. \\n\\nIsaiah 26:3 (ESV): You keep him in perfect peace \\r\\nwhose mind is stayed on you, \\r\\nbecause he trusts in you. \\n\\nPsalm 1:1–3 (ESV): Blessed is the man \\r\\nwho walks not in the counsel of the wicked, \\r\\nnor stands in the way of sinners, \\r\\nnor sits in the seat of scoffers; \\r\\n 2  but his delight is in the law of the Lord, \\r\\nand on his law he meditates day and night. \\r\\n 3  He is like a tree \\r\\nplanted by streams of water \\r\\nthat yields its fruit in its season, \\r\\nand its leaf does not wither. \\r\\nIn all that he does, he prospers. \\n\\nThese two passages reveal the key to conquering the bad habit of obsessing over problems—meditate on God’s Word. To put this in action, have a plan. Decide on a short verse or passage of Scripture that you have memorized. The next time thoughts of stress invade our review becomes blaming and planning becomes worrying, begin reviewing your chosen a scripture one word at a time. Think of all the implications of each word. Go slowly. Force yourself not to skip words. Ponder every single word. The Lord’s Prayer and Palm 23 are excellent options that most Christians know. Anything is fine. John 3:16 is also great.  Do not attempt to integrate how Good is going to take care of your word into your Scripture mediation. Focus your meditation on God and His role in the passage. Think of yourself a little as possible. This works especially well when you’re trying to fall asleep and find yourself worrying instead. You will be amazed how quickly you will be able to shut these thoughts down in a few days. As soon as you can resume your activity without worrying, do so. \\n\\nAfter I began practicing this an amazing thing happened. I started thinking about Scripture all the time. I started looking up passages that I was familiar with but hadn’t memorized so I could meditate on them. I discovered that meditating on Scripture anytime my mind was free was deeply fulfilling and peace inducing. I regard these moments as times of worship in which I trust God to take care of whatever I’m not thinking about.

No anti-God character, champion of evil, or arch enemy is needed for sin to arise. The self alone is a sufficient instigator of sin. \\n\\nSo where did Sin come from? It came from the creations themselves. \\n\\nIt is noteworthy that John Piper cannot imagine an answer to the question where did Lucifer’s first desire to Sin come from? Piper doesn’t believe in free will, so this explanation is not possible for him. A Calvinist’s insistence that God is the cause of all things is at odds with the Bible’s assertion that God is not the author of sin. \\n\\nIf this hypothesis is true, what does that tell us about the Genesis account of the fall of man?\\n\\nIn eating the forbidden fruit, man’s choice was in perfect keeping with the above hypothesis. It wasn’t a choice to follow Satan or any force opposed to God. It was a choice to rely on self instead of God. Without the knowledge of good and evil, man must trust God to handle this knowledge. The choice to know good and evil for themselves was a choice to stop trusting God and instead rely on self. \\n\\nI think this hypothesis actually enables us to get better insight into Gods plan. It eliminates the snake as a necessary catalyst for sin and thus true free will. \\n\\nBut the snake was there, pushing them toward that choice. Why?

They used their free will to violate their relationship with the Creator. \\n\\nRejecting God’s rule opened the door for sin to enter into the world. In particular, it made sin a natural part of every person’s heart. \\n\\nSin at its most basic is that which is antithetical to the Creator. He cannot be in the presence of sin. He cannot tolerate sin in the same way\\u202fa flame cannot tolerate the absence of oxygen. \\n\\nWith sin in the earth and in the very hearts of his masterpiece, God could no longer enjoy the direct relationships with mankind as he had with Adam and Eve. \\n\\nBut the Creator loved His masterpiece so much, He did not want to abandon it. \\n\\nHe devised a plan to reestablish relationships with his masterpiece. \\n\\nThe plan was for the Creator to be born as a human being and live in the now sin-filled world just as all people do. However, in his life, he would have to resist the sin all around him. He had to live a perfect life. He could never give in to sin because the point of the plan was for his sinless life to end in a sacrificial death that would satisfy the penalty for sin owed by every other person who had ever or would ever live. \\n\\nThe payment of the sin penalty would be offered to each individual as a gift that, like the Creator’s rules at the beginning of creation, could be accepted or rejected according to each individual’s free will. \\n\\nThat plan was executed in the person we know as Jesus. His death satisfied the penalty required for sin for every person who has ever or will ever live. \\n\\nWhen Jesus died, he defeated the power that is behind death and sin, and because of that, he was able to resurrect his physical body and live about thirty more days on the earth before ascending into the clouds and disappearing from the earth. \\n\\nBefore Jesus left, he told his followers he was going to be with his Father, the Creator, to prepare a place for them to come and be with him. \\n\\nHe also told his followers that he, Jesus, is the only way to the Creator. \\n\\nAs in the beginning, the Creator still desires a relationship with every individual, but He will not force anyone to have such a relationship. Instead, each individual must choose a relationship with Him. \\n\\nChoosing a relationship with the Creator requires that we acknowledge and turn away from sin because that it what is separating us from Him. \\n\\nJesus said, “They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.

So God had to figure out a way to rescue us from the sin we let into the world without also destroying us. That Way was Jesus--God\\\'s Son who is also fully God. Jesus humbled himself to be incarnated in human flesh in order that he might face human death.

They live in the near future where extensive genetic testing is mandatory part of prenatal care. There are risk thresholds for each undesirable genetic trait above which abortion is required. Zola really wants her baby because her husband is dead. When he is found to be above the threshold for tbd gene, she is transformed from a rule follower to someone willing to defy authority. \\n\\nShe uses her position in the dept of transport (over futuristic autonomous support road systems) to get an untraceable vehicle so she can go to another jurisdiction that won’t require abortion. In the process she discovers data indicating scandalous behavior related to dept of tax and autonomous vehicles. Just as she’s leaving she is intercepted by police because she has evaded abortion to her 35th week. She agrees to drive with escort to clinic planning to escape and wanting her car and stuff with her. She doesn’t escape before the procedure begins. She feels her baby sliding out of her body and thinks she failed but hears him cry. His cries give her energy to get up, grab him and run. But in the abortion his leg was damaged. \\n\\nShe escapes to a safe place and seems to have found her HEA.\\n\\nWhen boy is 5ish he dies of an epidemic because they can’t go to where treatment is available due to his leg. Wanting revenge, she adopts a false identity and returns to work at dept of tx to dig for more info. At the same time she is killing everyone involved in her sons abortion including the most powerful supporters of genetic health. \\n\\nFinally she escapes to a foreign enemy that opposes genetic health protocols. She has knowledge sufficient to hijack the road system but needs the resources of a national govt to do so. Her goal is to disrupt the economy to the point that genetic health protocols cannot be enforced and so that nation will be taken over by its neighbors who don’t have GHP\\n\\nSurface some mystery about husbands death and that her baby had a perfect ghp but they wanted baby dead too…why?

She is like David--a fugitive who has escaped to the hills to save her son, mamed in a botched, late term abortion performed against her will. She escaped with him but without one of his legs. We will leave the cause of these defects out of the first book. Let the reader believe they were the imperfections that motivated the compulsory abortion. \\n\\n## January 23, 2018 (don\\\'t think this is right...)\\nTriarii – google it. Zola\\\'s codename. Possibly book title. Contrast to Vanguard. Thanks Jn for both. \\n\\n \\n\\nHook \\n\\n \\n\\nMoments after inauguration, President Her orders a devastating strike on Israel which cripples—and for all intents and purposes, eliminates--the country. Friends Zola lost in the fighting are mercies, but the YouTube video of young children of dear Israeli friends ruthlessly tortured and killed on YouTube by the occupying PLA, breaks something, or breaks something free, in Zola.  \\n\\n \\n\\nShe doesn\\\'t panic. She doesn\\\'t "go rogue". She doesn\\\'t let on that anything is different today than it was yesterday. But methodically she marshals all her resources to discover how such a strike even occurred. How was there time to position the assets? How did President Her have all the information an experienced politician like herself would\\\'ve known to ask for? Why did she even make such a call? It wasn\\\'t her style. It wasn\\\'t in her political interests. What was going on? \\n\\n \\n\\nInciting Event \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen Zola discovers enough of the answers to these questions, the picture that begins to form is a frightening one. Individuals strategically placed throughout the Federal government had worked in concert to force the strike on Israel. They had been working toward that end since before President Magnum\\\'s election. \\n\\n \\n\\n1st Pinch Point \\n\\nOne of the anti-Israel bureaucrats is promoted to a key position in Dept of Transport and gains tremendous power over the new UGV infrastructure. Moving intelligence assets around the country just became a non-issue for the anti-Israel group. \\n\\n \\n\\nMidpoint \\n\\nThe unmistakable handwriting of her beloved mentor Rufio on one of the most damning documents proving the plot to destroy Israel had been in the works for years, hit Zola like a punch in the gut. This was not just a small group of power hungry bureaucrats gone rogue. This was a deliberate shadow government that operating out of the Dept of Treasury for decades and calling themselves the Vanguard. Their interest is not serving the American people but amassing wealth and power for themselves and the secret, elite group they serve. She had been nothing but a useful idiot to these traitors, and she would see them brought to justice. \\n\\n \\n\\nAction \\n\\nConsidering the amount of time the Vanguard has been operating, and Rufio\\\'s involvement, Zola realizes she may have some of Vanguard\\\'s information in her possession. A few years ago, she\\\'d mirrored Rufio\\\'s failing laptop drive. It hadn\\\'t seemed strange to her at the time that he had a lot of questions about whether the encrypted data on his disk would, at any point in the process, be readable to her. She was a green agent, less experienced than some of the interns. He had no reason to trust her. Despite her honest assurances that it would not be, he had insisted that she purchase the equipment to mirror the drives herself rather than paying a real techie to do it. For all his care to encrypt his data with the best technology he had access to at the time, he hadn\\\'t been savvy enough to ask for the original drive back or see to it that it was destroyed. And therefore, it was almost a certainty that the drive was in one of the several containers overflowing with deprecated tech which Zola could never throw away...just in case she needed a part. (Encryption used is now readily breakable, and failing disk drives are easily transferrable to SSDs etc. None of this could happen with today\\\'s hardware-based, TCP chip encryption techniques.) \\n\\n# Notes from Convo with J\\nPresident Magnus was a populist Republican who won a surprise election against President Her. Despite his popularity, mounting investigations and an aborted impeachment crippled the 3rd and 4th years of his Presidency. His incumbent campaign was hardly a contest, and President Her finally received her entitlement. \\n\\n \\n\\nBehind the scenes, an illuminati-like group known as Vanguard, had gained control of so much of the federal bureaucracy that they were, for all intents and purposes, a shadow government. Vanguard transcended political party. They were genetically jaded against their fellow countrymen, and indeed, humanity in general. They were oligarchs, concentrated in a small circle of families whose only objective was to get and retain wealth and power. They were self-righteously loyal to themselves only, the world and everyone in it were their pawns. \\n\\n \\n\\nThis group was desperate to gain the favor of the ever troublesome barbaric Middle East and their oil, and the only price that could buy that favor was the dissolution of Israel. For decades, every subterfuge they tried had failed as the tiny rebel country defied statistics and thrived against all odds. They were finally left with no option but to have Israel destroyed, but to do that, they would need a President of the most powerful country in the world to order the strike. Fortunately, there was one candidate just desperate and unscrupulous enough on hand, but the unlikely joke Magnus had blindsided, not to mention enraged, the Vanguard. Ironically, his own name had been mentioned as a possibility in the very early days of the plan, but he had been rejected as a loose cannon and unelectable to boot.  \\n\\n \\n\\nIt would take another four years of trumped up charges and witch hunts to oust Magnus and finally bring President Her to the oval office. She had paid her debts quickly, ordering the strike against Israel for its occupation of Lebanon within moments of her inauguration. Only someone who\\\'d spent as much time in as many positions as she had in Washington would\\\'ve known how to move so quickly. \\n\\n \\n\\nZola was a SS agent who knew enough to know that strike was a lot more than it seemed to be, but she did not know enough to know what else it was. When the initial curious investigation she made with what little access she had revealed discrepancies and unexplained anomalies, Zola\\\'s hackles went up. When she saw a YouTube video of her dear friend\\\'s children tortured and murdered by a PLA mob roving through Jerusalem, those hackled hardened into a steel spine intent to finding the truth behind the strike. \\n\\n \\n## 2014-04-17 \\nduring Jack\\\'s afternoon nap \\n\\nwho is my hero/ine? \\n\\nIt seems wise to write a heroine for my first novel since I\\\'m a woman, but I tend to be annoyed by heroines. Maybe that\\\'s because modern fictional heroines are liberal feminists, strange women. If I write a heroine, I want her to be a woman who fulfills her God-given role as a female per the complementarian view (John Piper\\\'s sermon "God Created Man Male and Female"). On the down-lo, of course, as I want it to be a NYT bestseller. \\n\\nPossible Title: The Strange Woman an irony as she is the opposite of the strange woman of the Bible \\n\\nMaybe it will be very exciting for me to write a heronie for the challenge of creating a character who answers liberal feminism\\\'s objections to a womans traditional role with a traditional woman. \\n\\nSo a heroine it shall be. \\n\\nThat settled, I already know I\\\'m going to write something undeniably spy-fi that is at the same time like no other spy-fi. I\\\'ve known what I wanted to write for a few weeks now, and the precise idea came to me today while listening to a Ted Talk on autonomous vehicles, which I shall refer to as \\n\\nUNMANNED GROUND VEHICLES (UGVs) \\n\\n(A heroine for a spy book about cars? This is sounding tough already.) \\n\\nWhen I looked into what publishers have to say about spy-fi, I discovered it\\\'s nothing more than spy books with futuristic technology thrown in. James Bond is spy-fi. This is not what I\\\'m going for. Maybe I am going to write a \\n\\nSCI-SPY \\n\\nthat is, most sci-fi than spy. It\\\'s going to be a spy book in a very futuristic setting. It doesn\\\'t seem that futuristic to me, but if James Bond is futuristic, my book will be set in the eons beyond. \\n\\nSTRANGEON \\n\\nI don\\\'t know why I\\\'m teasing myself by beating around the bush before writing what\\\'s already in my head. From here on out, I shall refer to this book as Novel the First, or NTF. \\n\\nNTF is a book about committing acts of war by hijacking systems that control UGVs. My heroine is the perpetrator of these acts. I want to explore questions about justification for war. Is terrorism a legitimate tool for war. When is revolution justified? When is deception justified? When do rulers lose their right to govern? What is the citizenry\\\'s responsibility for their leaders, for the acts committed in the name of their nation? Who is a citizen? Does national citizenship have meaning in the future? What are the transcendent objects of human loyalty? \\n\\nWow. I didn\\\'t know my book was going to be about all this, but this process rocks. These are all themes that fascinate me, and now I have a reason for diving into them all. \\n\\nThe dryer just buzzed...must keep thinking while I hang laundry. \\n\\n...late in the evening now. I just got home from Thursday knit night... \\n\\nJohnathan suggested the heroine\\\'s last name be Sparks. :) I like the sound of it, but I don\\\'t like the weird punctuation required to write the possessive of a noun ending in "s". She shall be Sparkman, and maybe they\\\'ll call her Sparks. \\n\\nSparks is a banker-turned-OCC-auditor-turned-Secret Service investigator. Early in her years with SS, Sparkman developed a good working relationship with members of the Israeli intelligence community. US-Israeli relations have deteriorated in recent years over [insert one of many possible real life landmines...Israeli pre-emptive strike against Iran, re-taking Palestinian territory, plans to rebuild the Temple]. \\n\\n\\n## 2014-4-20, \\nEaster, after everyone went home and I had a nap \\n \\n\\nA disillusioned mother goes rogue to make her own justice \\n\\nparagon transforms to pariah to exact punishment. \\n\\nA paragon becomes a pariah to punish her persecutors. \\n\\nSaboteur \\n\\nHell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Zola eschewed fury. Her bones were a cage of ice around the fire within her, and she did not allow herself to feel that fire often. Passion distracts, and Zola had a mission. Only in moments of doubt, at crucibles of action she did not want to take, did she allow herself to touch that fire, to remember why she repudiated so much that was once sacred to her. \\n\\nThis morning she was cold inside and out. Memphis springs are skizophrenic, and she foolishly assumed yesterday\\\'s shorts and tank weather signaled the end of jogging suit season for her mid-morning walks. She focused on her heel-to-toe cadence and wondered how violently she had to swing her arms to warm them. Fortunately today\\\'s mission didn\\\'t require any dexterity in her fingers. She\\\'d planted the explosives under the city\\\'s landmark M bridge long before winter threatened to end. Winter clothes made it easy to hide the C4 and remotely-triggered detonator on her person.

In the Q&A for the second episode, you wondered why human beings have a choice between god and evil, but you didn\\\'t have an answer. \\n\\nThis question is something that has dogged me since I was a child. I had a devout Christian upbringing, and Bible study was very serious business at both home and church. I\\\'m no theologian, but I have spent all my years steeped in the Bible, and always puzzling over why God created a world with any possibility for sin. In the last 10 years, I\\\'ve pursued an answer vigorously. \\n\\nI don\\\'t presume to have an answer because the Bible doesn\\\'t tell us directly, and there is too much we don\\\'t fathom about God to be dogmatic with our speculations. However, I have a theory that at least is not contradicted by Scripture, and at best has some indirect Scriptural support. \\n\\nIt\\\'s almost trivial to say that the Almighty Creator of all things has an inherent imbalance of power with all things. But the Bible reveals what He wants. "Without faith, it is impossible to please God." Theologian Michael Heiser summarizes God\\\'s demands on us as "believing loyalty." In the 10 Commandments He tells us he is a jealous God. When Jesus was questioned by the religious leaders of his day, he affirmed the beloved Shema of the Jews, "Thou shal ...\\n\\nBut how is the Almighty to receive this in any meaningful way from his creations with whom he has such an imbalance of power?\\n\\nOne way is to empower the creations, and he did. He created a realm of our own. His perfect plan was for us to rule over the realm, to fill the earth and subdue it.He gave us the Garden of Eden as an example of the successful outcome of our mandate. \\n\\nAnother way is to provide a choice. That is why the serpent was allowed to try to sway Eve\\\'s behavior. The tree was put in the garden to be a material manifestation of a heart condition in which Adam and Eve no longer trusted in God more than themselves. They wanted to know whatever there was to be known instead of leaving that knowledge to God and trusting him to \', \'title\': \'Why do we have a choice \', \'userEditedTimestampUsec\': 1687663935958000, \'createdTimestampUsec\': 1687662009077000, \'keep_export_file\': \'Why do we have a choice_.json\', \'created_at\': \'2023-06-24_220009\', \'edited_at\': \'2023-06-24_223215\', \'tags\': [\'created-2023\']}', "{'color': 'DEFAULT', 'isTrashed': False, 'isPinned': False, 'isArchived': False, 'textContent': 'Being pigeonholed into much less than capabilities\\n\\nI am not an analyst and I have no desire to be\\n\\nNo staging server after 2 years\\n\\nHaving to do contest reporting\\n\\nBeing asked to undertake huge BI tasks without adequate resources\\n\\nGenerally, not having the skill set I possess recognized and appreciated and instead being assigned more and more tasks that do not take advantage of my strengths', 'title': 'Why I left Terminix', 'userEditedTimestampUsec': 1600542698663000, 'createdTimestampUsec': 1572460125663000, 'labels': [{'name': 'Resume'}, {'name': 'journal'}, {'name': 'employment'}, {'name': 'Workplace'}], 'keep_export_file': 'Why I left Terminix.json', 'created_at': '2019-10-30_132845', 'edited_at': '2020-09-19_141138', 'tags': ['resume', 'journal', 'employment', 'workplace', 'created-2019']}", '{\'color\': \'BLUE\', \'isTrashed\': False, \'isPinned\': False, \'isArchived\': False, \'textContent\': \'"Christians do not believe that life is sacred because of who we are, but rather because of who the Creator is." \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nAl Mohler, The Briefing, 2015-04-15 ~18:27 \', \'title\': \'Why Life is Sacred\', \'userEditedTimestampUsec\': 1577847505532000, \'createdTimestampUsec\': 1577847498244000, \'labels\': [{\'name\': \'Quotes\'}], \'keep_export_file\': \'Why Life is Sacred.json\', \'created_at\': \'2019-12-31_205818\', \'edited_at\': \'2019-12-31_205825\', \'tags\': [\'quotes\', \'color-blue\', \'created-2019\']}', '{\'color\': \'BLUE\', \'isTrashed\': False, \'isPinned\': False, \'isArchived\': False, \'textContent\': "Rich Man and Lazarus\\nLuke 16:19-\\nD Sinquefield 2018-06-24\\n\\nRich man\'s argument to Abraham that his brothers will not believe the written word but they would believe if one came back from the dead to tell them, and Abraham said no they would not even believe then...\\n\\nThis made me think of other examples in the Bible of wealthy people coming to faith.
