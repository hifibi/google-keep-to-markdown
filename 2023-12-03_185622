This system will include real-time Markdown linting and the ability to generate html, docx, and pdf documents quickly with the potential to produce many other document formats as well. Markdown is a simple markup language that allows one to write documents using a text editor and transform those documents into many different formats.  Among other things, it works beautifully for documenting source code since the Markdown documents can be checked in and versioned with Git or your source control system of choice.

This approach is an anti pattern that is the antithesis of the data revolution underway in nearly every area of life, particularly Business endeavors. \n\nDenying business analysts access to data and reporting tools is an anti-pattern characteristic of IT organizations that prioritize turf protection above all else. \n\nThe end result of this policy is an overwhelming burden on the BI team. Work formerly performed across many business departments is concentrated on BI developers. This is the classic, unsustainable anti-pattern that gave rise to tools like Power BI. \n\nThe choice of a tool like Power BI to support centralized BI represents fundamental lack of awareness of the technology. Power BI is the poster-child of self-service BI platforms. It was designed specifically to thwart centralized BI. It is intended to empower businesses in defiance of exactly the kind of IT turf protection Ayman is trying to affect. \n\nFor me as BI developer, the impact is a job that promises nothing but constant stress and failure. Furthermore, working for leadership with such backwards thinking cannot provide the opportunity I\u2019m looking for.
